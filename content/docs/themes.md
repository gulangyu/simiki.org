Simiki theme use [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/), a full featured template engine, based on Python.

A simplest theme only need `index.html` and `page.html`:

* `index.html` is used for index page as catalog
* `page.html` is used for every wiki page.

Default theme named `simple` will exists after initialled wiki site.
